Suppose we have a system that has 100 users,
each used has a unique ID,
and we have a UserService with updateUser(userId) method,
we need to control the update operation.
In which, we need to prevent update the same user in the same time,
which means if we have two threads that are calling updateUser(10), one of them needs to wait until the first one finish its call.
If we have two threads one is calling for (updateUser(10)) and the second updateUser(20), two threads can run concurrently .
